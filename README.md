Leaf Disease Detection using Python

This project aims to develop a leaf disease detection system using Python. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically identify and classify diseases in plant leaves based on images.

Features:
- Dataset: The project includes a dataset of plant leaf images with labeled disease classes for training and testing the model.
- Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to enhance features and remove noise, ensuring better accuracy in disease detection.
- Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed leaf images using image processing techniques and computer vision algorithms.
- Machine Learning Model: The project trains a machine learning model using the extracted features to classify leaves into different disease classes.
- Disease Classification: The trained model is used to classify new leaf images and predict the presence of diseases accurately.
- GUI Interface: The project provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to upload leaf images and obtain disease detection results.
